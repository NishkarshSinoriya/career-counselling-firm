          <p>Symbiosis National Aptitude (SNAP) Test is a national-level management entrance examination, conducted by Symbiosis International University (SIU).

            This year, the authorities have moved away with the conventional pen-paper based exam and have introduced the exam in an online mode. Since the examâ€™s inception in the year 2007, this is the first time that it will be conducted in a computer-based mode.
